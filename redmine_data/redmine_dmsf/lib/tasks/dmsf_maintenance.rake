DMSF maintenance task
  * Remove all files with no database record from the document directory
  * Remove all links project_id = -1 (added links to an issue which hasn't been created)
  * Report all documents without a corresponding file in the file system (dry_run only)

Available options:
  *dry_run - No physical deletion but to list of all unused files only

Example:
  rake redmine:dmsf_maintenance RAILS_ENV="production"
  rake redmine:dmsf_maintenance dry_run=1 RAILS_ENV="production"
